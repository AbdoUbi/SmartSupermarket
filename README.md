# SmartSupermarket
This project is my senior thesis for my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the American University in Bulgaria.
--------------------
Abstract:
This Arduino-based project aims to revolutionize customers' shopping experience by automating the checkout process into a fast, efficient self-checkout process while shopping. The project is based on one Arduino UNO, one NodeMCU V2 ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module, one loadcells, one loadcell amplifier, an Ultrasonic sensor, and a tilt sensor. This project will be a demonstration of a supermarket where customers can simply walk in and pick up the items they want, and while they are putting the items in the shopping cart/basket, the process of self-checkout is happening at the same time. The store will have a facial recognition entrance, only allowing recognized faces who signed up to use this service and provided their credit card information. The program will combine tilt-sensing, weight-sensing, and barcode scanning to detect what items customers add to their baskets. The project has the potential to save time and reduce the need for manual labor while improving the overall shopping experience for customers.
